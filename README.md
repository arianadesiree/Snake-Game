# Snake-Game

# Project Name
The Snake Game

# Description
The snake game, as the classic game is played, a user will be able to earn points by chasing its "food" with the snake. As each level increases everytime the snack reaches its food, the speed will get faster for the snake. This is a browser-based web game utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# How to get Started
1. Create a viable HTML code to show the score and buttons
2. Create the CSS to set the grid for the game and sizing
3. Define our variables in Javascript and functions for the game

Any Challenges I expect?
* Javascript as a whole, but mainly the functions to get the snake to move, go faster, and work the score board.
* HTML and CSS are not too difficult for me, but possibly getting them to connect with Javascript, and calling the buttons may be a problem for me.
